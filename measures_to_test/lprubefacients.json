    " and are available on prescription and in OTC remedies. They may contain nicotinate compounds, salicylate compounds, essential oils and camphor.</p>",
    "<p>The BNF states: &ldquo;The evidence available does not support the use of topical rubefacients in acute or chronic musculoskeletal pain&rdquo;.</p>",
    "<p>NICE has issued the following &lsquo;do not do&rsquo; recommendation: Do not offer rubefacients for treating osteoarthritis.</p>",

    "<p>Other miscellaneous topical analgesics containing benzydamine, mucopolysaccharide polysulphate or cooling ingredients fall under this category. Benzydamine and mucopolysaccharide ",
    "are weak prostaglandin inhibitors and are therefore pharmacologically different from those routinely referred to as NSAIDs in current practice (such as ibuprofen and diclofenac), ",
    "so it cannot be presumed that the clinical evidence relating to NSAIDs can be extrapolated to benzydamine or mucopolysaccharide polysulphate containing products ",
