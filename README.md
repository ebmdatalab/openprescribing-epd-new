# OpenPrescribing English Prescribing Data Change Detector

The **OpenPrescribing English Prescribing Data Change Detector** is a tool designed to identify new or altered items in the [English Prescribing Data](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/prescription-data/prescribing-data/english-prescribing-data-epd) published by the NHS Business Services Authority.

## New Items Reports

Our [New Items Reports](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/ebmdatalab/openprescribing-epd-new/blob/main/reports/list_reports.html) provide detailed information in three key sections:

1. **New or Changed Chemical Substance Descriptions**  
   For example, a new drug being prescribed in primary care for the first time (mostly) or an existing chemical substance description changing (rarely)

2. **New or Changed BNF Codes**  
   For example, a new drug or new formulation/strength of an existing drug being prescribed in primary care for the first time (mostly) or an existing BNF code changing (occasionally).

3. **New or Changed BNF Descriptions**  
   For example, updated or modified descriptions of existing items.  

## OpenPrescribing Tests

Our [OpenPrescribing Tests Reports](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/ebmdatalab/openprescribing-epd-new/blob/main/reports/list_test_reports.html) enable us to identify new items that may impact our existing measures, helping to ensure the accuracy and relevance of our prescribing tools.
